I decided to do my project on video game stats! Namely, stats from Pokémon. Basically I found a csv
repository online that's full of data on the Pokémon series of video games, and I plan to visualise it
in several different ways. So far I have a bar chart set up that displays the stats of pokemon if you
enter their id number with the keyboard. I also plan to display their sprite and cry along with it,
making use of audio software. I'll also try and implement classes to store the stat data and add another
few types of visualisations!
