First Deliverable Readme:

I decided to do my project on video game stats! Namely, stats from Pokémon. Basically I found a csv
repository online that's full of data on the Pokémon series of video games, and I plan to visualise it in several different ways. So far I have a bar chart set up that displays the stats of Pokémon if you enter their id number with the keyboard. I also plan to display their sprite and cry along with it, making use of audio software. I'll also try and implement classes to store the stat data and add another few types of visualisations!


Second Deliverable Readme (Assignment Submission):

My completed project is on Pokémon stat analysis. It incorporates three visualisations, sprite animation, and audio playback. It uses classes to store species data, including stats, ID number, sprite and cry.
The colour of the species’ total stats indicates how strong it is. The weaker species are more of a red color, and the stronger species are more yellow. One of the two bar charts I created displays the stats of one Pokémon, and another bar chart shows the stats of all Pokémon.
The asignment is controlleed by the keyboard. Pressing + and - will cycle through species in both visualisations that show individual species. Pressing b will show the small bar chart, pressign a will show the chart with all species, and pressing s will show the spread graph.
I was able to play the animated sprite and cry by importing the libraries, mimin and gifAnimation.
